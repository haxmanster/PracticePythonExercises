'''Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd.
print out an appropriate message to the user

Extras:
1.If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
2.Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check)
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
'''


number = int(input("Number to check:"))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("You have wrote an even number.")
else:
    print("This number is odd.")
#Extras
if number % 4 == 0:
    print("This number is a multiple of 4.")
check = int(input("Number to divide the number by:"))
if number % check == 0:
    print(number,"divides evenly by",check)
else:
    print(number,"does not divides evenly by",check)
