'''Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function'''

def new_list(liSt:list) -> list:
    newlist = [liSt[0],liSt[-1]]
    return newlist

example = new_list([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
