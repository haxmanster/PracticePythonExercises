'''
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.
Extras:
1.Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5
from this list in it and print out this new list.
2.Write this in one line of Python.
3.Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the orginal list a(This one at
the top) that are smaller than that number given by the user'''


    
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
bigger = []
limit = int(input("What's the maximum number you want to look for?:"))
for number in a:
    if number < limit:
        bigger.append(number)
print(bigger)
